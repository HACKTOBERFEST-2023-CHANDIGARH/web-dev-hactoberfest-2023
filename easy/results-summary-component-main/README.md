## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While developing this project I learned about HTMLCollection, in HTMlCollection you can't use forEach loop as HTMLCollections do not have the forEach method by default. So To access elements you can foor loop (normal one).

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<img class="img-icon" alt="reaction-icon" />
```

```js
const imgCollection = document.getElementsByTagName("img");

for(let i = 0 ; i < imgCollection.length; i++) {
    const img = imgCollection[i]
    img.setAttribute("src", eleData[i].icon)
}
```
